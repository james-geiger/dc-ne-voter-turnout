## Abstract

Historically, the trend in voter participation for elections in the United
States is based on the expansion of voting rights. Voter turnout becomes gradually
larger over the years as access to voting is made easier and more equitable.  In
this research, the analysis of voter turnout will be focused on Douglas County,
Nebraska. Using public data from the Douglas County Election Commission and the
United States Census Bureau, we identify a positive trend in voter registration
in the past 20 years, especially among voters who identify as other- or non-partisan.
We furthermore identify an upward trend in population growth among White residents
while the population of other demographic groups remains flat. Ultimately, we present
a preliminary model that local election commissions could employ to predict voter
turnout by predicting voter turnout for the 2020 general election.  The results
of the preliminary model are promisingâ€”the model was able to predict turnout to
a difference within 3,000 voters.
